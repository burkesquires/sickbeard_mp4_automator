    "    - `move_to` = you may specify one final directory to move the completed file. (Use this option for the 'Automatically Add to iTunes' folder)\n",

    "    - `relocate_moov` = True/False - relocates the MOOV atom to the beginning of the file for better streaming\n",
    "    - `ios-audio` = creates a 2nd copy of an audio stream that will be iOS compatible (AAC Stereo) if the normal output will not be. If a stereo source stream is detected with this option enabled, an AAC stereo stream will be the only one produced (essentially overriding the codec option) to avoid multiple stereo audio stream copies in different codecs. Instead of 'true' you may also set this option to a specific codec to override the default.\n",
    "    - `ios-first-track-only` = Applies the `ios-audio` option only to the first audio track encountered in the source video file. This prevents making dual audio streams for additional alternative language codecs or commentary tracks that may be present in the source file.\n",

    "    - `max-audio-channels` = Sets a maximum number of audio channels. This may provide an alternative to the iOS audio option, where instead users can simply select the desired output codec and the max number of audio channels without the creation of an additional audio track.\n",
    "    - `use-hevc-qsv-decoder` = Enable HEVC decoding using QSV on supported Intel chips. 6th Generation skylake and newer.\n",
    "    - `enable_dxva2_gpu_decode` = Enable GPU decoding by using DXVA2 - Windows only. Will automatically fallback to cpu decoding when it encounters a video that it cannot decode due to unsupported pixel/color/codec. Enabling this option will disable qsv decoding of hevc and h264.\n",
    "    - `video-codec` = set your desired video codecs. May specify multiple comma separated values (ex: h264, x264). The first value specified will be the default conversion choice when an undesired codec is encountered; any codecs specified here will be remuxed/copied rather than converted.\n",
    "    - `video-bitrate` = allows you to set a maximum video bitrate in Kbps. If the source file exceeds the video-bitrate it will be transcoded to the specified video-bitrate, even if they source file is already in the correct video codec. If the source file is in the correct video codec and does not exceed the video-bitrate setting, then it will be copied without transcoding. Leave blank to disable this setting.\n",

    "    - `video-max-width` = set a max video width to downsize higher resolution video files. Aspect ratio will be preserved.\n",
    "    - `h264-max-level` = set your max h264 level. Use the decimal format. Levels lower than the specified value, if otherwise appropriate, will be copied without transcoding. Example - `4.0`.\n",

    "    - `audio-codec` = set your desired audio codecs. May specify multiple comma separated values (ex: ac3, aac). The first value specified will be the default conversion choice when an undesired codec is encountered; any codecs specified here will be remuxed/copied rather than converted.\n",
    "    - `audio-channel-bitrate` = set the bitrate for each audio channel. Default is 256. Setting this value to 0 will attempt to mirror the bitrate of the audio source, but this can be unreliable as bitrates vary between different codecs.\n",
    "    - `audio-language` = 3 letter language code for audio streams you wish to copy. Leave blank to copy all. Separate multiple audio streams with commas (ex: eng,spa)\n",
    "    - `audio-default-language` = If an audio stream with an unidentified/untagged language is detected, you can default that language tag to whatever this value is (ex: eng). This is useful for many single-audio releases which don't bother to tag the audio stream as anything\n",
    "    - `audio-filter` = Applies FFMPEG audio filter. Make sure you specify all parameters as you would using the `-af` option with FFMPEG command line\n",
    "    - `aac_adtstoasc` = Applies the aac_adtstoasc filter to AAC channels being copied. Useful if your source of mkv's uses raw ADTS AAC containers but can cause some playback issues with certain audio encoders\n",
    "    - `audio-copy-original` = Copies the original audio stream to the destination regardless of codec to preserve it. Will not redundantly copy the steam if its already a valid/supported codec\n",
    "    - `subtitle-codec` = set your desired subtitle codec. If you're embedding subs, `mov_text` is the only option supported. If you're creating external subtitle files, `srt` or `webvtt` are accepted.\n",
    "    - `subtitle-language` = same as audio-language but for subtitles. Set to `nil` to disable copying of subtitles.\n",
    "    - `subtitle-language-default` = same as audio-language-default but for subtitles\n",
    "    - `convert-mp4` = forces the script to reprocess and convert mp4 files as though they were mkvs. Good if you have old mp4's that you want to match your current codec configuration. *Caution:* Set `ios-audio` to `False` when reprocessing files to avoid adding multiple iOS audio streams.\n",
    "    - `fullpathguess` = True/False - When manually processing a file, enable to guess metadata using the full path versus just the file name. (Files shows placed in a 'Movies' folder will be recognized as movies, not as TV shows for example.)\n",
    "    - `tagfile` = True/False - Enable or disable tagging file with appropriate metadata after encoding.\n",
    "    - `tag-language` = en - Set your tag language for TMDB/TVDB entries metadata retrieval. Use either 2 or 3 character language codes.\n",
    "    - `download-artwork` = Poster/Thumbnail/False - Enabled downloading and embeddeding of Season or Movie posters and embeddeding of that image into the mp4 as the cover image. For TV shows you may choose between the season artwork or the episode thumbnail by selecting the corresponding option.\n",
    "    - `embed-subs` = True/False - Enabled by default. Embeds subtitles in the resulting MP4 file that are found embedded in the source file as well as external SRT/VTT files. Disabling embed-subs will cause the script to extract any subtitles that meet your language criteria into external SRT/VTT files. The script will also attempt to download SRT files if possible and this feature is enabled.\n",
